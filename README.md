## 🎯 Executive Summary

This **Real-Time Bike Rental Demand Forecasting System** solves a critical business problem for bike-sharing platforms operating across entire cities. The system provides hour-ahead demand predictions that drive dynamic pricing strategies, enabling revenue optimization and improved fleet utilization.


## Business Problem Solved

**Challenge**: Bike-sharing platforms need to optimize dynamic pricing based on predicted demand to:
- **Maximize Revenue**: Increase prices during high-demand surges
- **Stimulate Demand**: Lower prices during slow periods to attract riders
- **Optimize Fleet**: Better plan supply-demand balance and bike distribution

**Solution**: A real-time ML system that forecasts city-wide bike rental demand for the next hour, enabling:
- **Dynamic Pricing Optimization**: Real-time price adjustments based on demand forecasts
- **Incentive Campaigns**: Targeted promotions during predicted low-demand periods
- **Operational Planning**: Improved fleet utilization and supply-demand balance

### End-to-End ML Pipeline Architecture

The system implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline with five distinct stages:

#### 1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**
- **Column Renaming**: Configurable column mapping for data standardization
- **Column Dropping**: Removal of unnecessary columns based on configuration
- **Data Reset**: Index reset for clean data structure
- **Configuration-Driven**: All preprocessing steps controlled via config parameters

#### 2. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
- **Lag Features**: Creation of time-lagged features for time series forecasting
- **Configurable Lags**: Multiple lag periods (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 periods) for different features
- **Backward Fill**: Handling of missing values in lag features using bfill method
- **Feature Naming**: Automatic naming convention: `{feature}_lag_{period}`

#### 3. **Training Pipeline**
- **Target Creation**: Shifted target variable for forecasting (configurable shift period)
- **Time-Series Split**: Train-test split without shuffling to preserve temporal order
- **CatBoost Model**: Gradient boosting regressor with configurable parameters
- **Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated optimization of learning_rate, depth, and l2_leaf_reg
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with configurable early stopping rounds
- **Time-Based Validation**: Manual validation split within training data

#### 4. **Inference Pipeline**
- **Model Loading**: Dynamic model loading from specified path
- **Single Prediction**: Returns only the last prediction value for real-time forecasting
- **Feature Preparation**: Input DataFrame processing for model inference
- **Timestamp Integration**: Current timestamp handling for prediction tracking

#### 5. **Postprocessing Pipeline**
- **Model Persistence**: Automated model saving after training
- **Prediction Formatting**: Single-row DataFrame with timestamp and prediction columns
- **Time Increment**: Configurable time increment for prediction timestamps
- **Data Structure**: Standardized output format for downstream processing

#----- issue while running Jupyter notebook locally ---
    # 1. Check what kernels Jupyter thinks are running

    # In a terminal:

    jupyter server list


    # If there’s more than one server running and you’re connecting to an old one, kill all of them and start a single clean       one.

    # In the browser (JupyterLab):
    # File → Shut Down → shut down all kernels and terminals.

    # 2. Make sure your environment isn’t half-broken

    # You’re running Python 3.14 according to that path:

    # .../Python.framework/Versions/3.14/lib/python3.14/...


    # That’s bleeding-edge. Some Jupyter stack pieces may be buggy or not fully tested against it.

    # If weirdness persists:

    # Create a clean venv with a mainstream Python (3.11 or 3.12).

    Install Jupyter there:

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install jupyterlab ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name clean-env --display-name "Python (clean-env)"
    jupyter lab


    # In the UI, pick the Python (clean-env) kernel.

    # If the error disappears in the clean env, your old environment is just messy.
# --- fix-------
